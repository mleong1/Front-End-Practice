    <p id="firstParagraph">This is the story of a young programmer from Brooklyn, New York. He wants to be someone great, but sometimes he has
    problems pushing and working hard to get what he wants. All of his life he has been handed his way to the next step with
    little opposition. But to be truly great he always comes up short.</p>

<div>
    <p id="secondParagraph">It wasn't until he studied at the great temple in Saratoga Springs that he learned it wasn't
    enough to simply get by without understanding what he was doing. He needed hardwork and practice. It wasn't enough
    to be better than everyone around him. He needed to be better than himself and then even better than that. From that
    day forth, he practiced programming every day to defeat the three headed dragon of procrastination, doubt, and mediocrity.
    The hero's tale goes on to this day. I wish him safe passage, and I hope he makes it.</p>
